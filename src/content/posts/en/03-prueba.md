If your dream has always been to be able to work for **startups** or companies abroad but unfortunately you feel insecure that you can succeed because you still need to improve your level of English, especially your ability to speak fluently, this is a very common problem, since most of us read and understand conversations or content we see online. This problem is very common, since the vast majority of Latinos read and understand the conversations or content we see on the internet, but taking it to a work environment is another level and especially when we have not had the opportunity to live in a country where the main language is English.

But today all that can change, if you follow this specialized 8-week plan we have designed to transform your spoken English level from intermediate to advanced. Whether you are preparing for a future job interview or planning to study an MBA program in an English-speaking country, this program offers you practical activities to incorporate into your daily routine without having to spend big budgets on academies or attend boring classes.

## How can you become a fluent English speaker?
The real breakthrough comes when you **learn to think in English**. This cognitive process eliminates the need to constantly translate from your native language, allowing you to respond more naturally and quickly during conversations in English.
This mental shift is critical to avoiding awkward pauses and projecting confidence during an interview. The key is to master introductory phrases and connectors that give you time to organize your ideas while maintaining conversational flow, an essential skill for making a good first impression.

## Calendar of activities - 8 intensive weeks
