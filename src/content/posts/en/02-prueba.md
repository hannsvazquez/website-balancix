![Special partnership My WorkIn and Balancix.](/public/blog-imgs/Alianza%20estrategica.png)

At [Balancix](https://www.balancix.site/en/) we have the firm conviction that in order to build a prosperous Latin America with high-impact technology companies, not only more capital investment is required, but also the development of talents that will lead emerging startups in this new era of Artificial Intelligence. With this vision, we have explored various strategies to promote our pre-recruitment preparation system designed for startups to reach more university students, considering that in many regions there is little diffusion of these opportunities. Therefore, starting today we will establish strategic alliances with startups, government entities and even Venture Capital funds to expand our offer to new horizons.

## Why are we partnerig with MyWorkIn?

In [MyWorkIn](https://www.workin2.com/) we have found a great opportunity to complement the services we both offer to make the student experience easier and more accessible. MyWorkIn's platform offers advanced functionalities that allow students to autonomously prepare for job interviews through an AI chatbot integrated with WhatsApp. At the end of each interview, the system generates a detailed report on the candidate's profile. At Balancix, we have decided to integrate this technology to provide our clients (both startups and students) with a more accurate and efficient analysis during the selection process.

## Main benefits of the partnership
The main benefit of this collaboration is the optimization of time in the evaluation of candidates, while simultaneously training talent in those specific skills and tools that enhance their attractiveness to startups, which are constantly looking for professionals with advanced digital competencies.

> Starting April 8, a form will be available on the MyWorkIn website to access a special 10% discount on any of our plans, both the Started and Global. Both programs include a month 100% focused on coaching sessions and personalized follow-up to maximize your hiring opportunities. The main difference between both plans lies in the English immersion offered by the Global plan.

This strategic partnership also allows us to expand our network of mentors and raise the quality of our programs thanks to the participation of experienced professionals who are currently working in important startups in Peru and the Latin America region. No doubt, more surprises and benefits are in store for our student community.

If you consider that your university, company or public institution could establish a similar alliance with us, do not hesitate to contact us at balancix3@gmail.com. We will evaluate every proposal carefully.

See you next week with more news and valuable content for your professional development in the startup ecosystem.
